**A comprehensive manufacturing analytics platform for Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) analysis, forecasting, and optimization.**

This project provides a complete solution for manufacturing performance analysis through:

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Automated preprocessing of production and line status data
- **Statistical Analysis**: ARIMA modeling and time series analysis for OEE patterns
- **Deep Learning Forecasting**: Advanced neural networks for multi-horizon OEE prediction
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based web application for real-time analytics
- **AI Advisory System**: RAG-powered intelligent recommendations for OEE improvement

 **Key Features**
==================

 **Comprehensive Analytics**
   - Real-time OEE calculation (Availability Ã— Performance Ã— Quality)
   - Multi-line production performance comparison
   - Historical trend analysis and pattern recognition

 **Advanced Forecasting**
   - Multiple deep learning architectures (RNN, CNN, WaveNet-style)
   - Multi-step ahead predictions with uncertainty quantification
   - Walk-forward validation for realistic performance assessment

 **AI-Powered Insights**
   - RAG-based advisory system for manufacturing optimization
   - Document-driven knowledge base for best practices

   - Real-time alerts and status indicators

 **Project Architecture**
==========================

The project is built around three core Jupyter notebooks that progressively build upon each other:

1. **OEE_Insights_1.ipynb**: Data preprocessing and OEE calculation foundation
2. **OEE_Insights_2.ipynb**: Statistical modeling and ARIMA-based forecasting
3. **OEE_Insights_3.ipynb**: Deep learning models for advanced time series prediction

These notebooks feed into a comprehensive Streamlit application that provides:

- Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Advanced forecasting capabilities with multiple model options
- AI-powered advisory system for optimization recommendations

 **Results Overview**
=======================

Our comprehensive analysis across multiple production lines demonstrates:

**Statistical Models (ARIMA)**
   - LINE-01: ARIMA(0,1,2) - Best for non-stationary data with MA components
   - LINE-03: ARIMA(1,0,1) - Optimal for stationary data with AR and MA terms
   - LINE-04: ARIMA(2,0,0) - Pure autoregressive model for trend-following data
   - LINE-06: ARIMA(1,0,0) - Simple AR model for predictable patterns

**Deep Learning Models**
   - **Best Overall**: Multi-Kernel CNN (LB=30) - Superior pattern recognition
   - **Best for LINE-06**: Multi-Kernel CNN - MAE: 0.0591, MAPE: 8.63%
   - **Most Stable**: Stacked RNN with Masking - Consistent across all lines
   - **Fastest Training**: WaveNet-style CNN - Efficient dilated convolutions

**Forecasting Performance**
   - Average MAE across all models: 0.06-0.13 (6-13% error rate)
   - Best performing line: LINE-06 (Manufacturing optimization success)
   - Most challenging: LINE-01 (High variability, requires advanced models)
